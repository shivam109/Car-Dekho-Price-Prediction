# Car-Dekho-Price-Prediction

Problem Statement: The primary objective of is project is to create a data science solution for predicting used car prices accurately by analyzing a diverse dataset including car model, no. of owners, age, mileage, fuel type, kilometers driven, features and location. The aim is to build a machine learning model that offers users to find current valuations for used cars.

Technologies Used: 
Python
Streamlit
Data Cleaning
