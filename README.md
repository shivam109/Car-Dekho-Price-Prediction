# Car-Dekho-Price-Prediction

Problem Statement: The primary objective of is project is to create a data science solution for predicting used car prices accurately by analyzing a diverse dataset including car model, no. of owners, age, mileage, fuel type, kilometers driven, features and location. The aim is to build a machine learning model that offers users to find current valuations for used cars.

car_dekho_dataset.ipynb ----> This file contains the process of cleaning the unstructured excel datasets and obtaining important features. After combining these excel datasets and creating one comnined_dataset. After performing various operations, we obtained features from those datasets.

combined_data.csv ----> This file needs to be preprocessed and visualized before training the model.

CONCLUSION
After trying a few models we conclude that GradientBoosingRegressor outperformed other models with evaluation metrics as Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 159292.7830515388 Mean Squared Error (MSE): 179283892377.9353 R-squared (R2): 0.8668297341589066
